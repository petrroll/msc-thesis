\chapter{Key and related works}

In this chapter, we start by introducing the \cite{antolik} model, which will be the main focus of our experiments. Further, we describe a model by \cite{klidnt}, whose separable layer contribution we will also explore. To provide some background, we finish with a quick look at a few additional related works.
