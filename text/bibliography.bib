    abstract = {Author Summary A key goal in sensory neuroscience is to understand the relationship between sensory stimuli and patterns of activity they elicit in networks of sensory neurons. Many models have been proposed in the past; however, these models have largely ignored the known architecture of primary visual cortex revealed in experimental studies, thus limiting their ability to accurately describe neural responses to sensory stimuli. Here we propose a model of primary visual cortex that takes into account the known architecture of visual cortex, specifically the fact that only a limited number of thalamic inputs with stereotypical receptive fields are shared within a local area of visual cortex, and the hierarchical progression from neurons with linear receptive fields (simple cells) to neurons with non-linear receptive fields (complex cells). We show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for receptive field estimation when fitted to two-photon calcium recordings of local populations of mouse V1 neurons responding to natural image stimuli. The model demonstrates how the diverse set of receptive fields in the local population of neurons can be constructed from a limited number (< 20) thalamic inputs.},

	abstract = {We can claim that we know what the visual system does once we can predict neural responses to arbitrary stimuli, including those seen in nature. In the early visual system, models based on one or more linear receptive fields hold promise to achieve this goal as long as the models include nonlinear mechanisms that control responsiveness, based on stimulus context and history, and take into account the nonlinearity of spike generation. These linear and nonlinear mechanisms might be the only essential determinants of the response, or alternatively, there may be additional fundamental determinants yet to be identified. Research is progressing with the goals of defining a single {\textquotedblleft}standard model{\textquotedblright} for each stage of the visual pathway and testing the predictive power of these models on the responses to movies of natural scenes. These predictive models represent, at a given stage of the visual pathway, a compact description of visual computation. They would be an invaluable guide for understanding the underlying biophysical and anatomical mechanisms and relating neural responses to visual perception.},

    abstract = { With modern neurophysiological methods able to record neural activity throughout the visual pathway in the context of arbitrarily complex visual stimulation, our understanding of visual system function is becoming limited by the available models of visual neurons that can be directly related to such data. Different forms of statistical models are now being used to probe the cellular and circuit mechanisms shaping neural activity, understand how neural selectivity to complex visual features is computed, and derive the ways in which neurons contribute to systems-level visual processing. However, models that are able to more accurately reproduce observed neural activity often defy simple interpretations. As a result, rather than being used solely to connect with existing theories of visual processing, statistical modeling will increasingly drive the evolution of more sophisticated theories. }

abstract={Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that, based on patterns of activity evoked by different categories of visual images, it is possible to deduce simple features in the visual scene, or to which category it belongs. Kay et al. take this approach a tantalizing step further. Their newly developed decoding method, based on quantitative receptive field models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and fMRI activity in early visual areas, can identify with high accuracy which specific natural image an observer saw, even for an image chosen at random from 1,000 distinct images. This prompts the thought that it may soon be possible to decode subjective perceptual experiences such as visual imagery and dreams, an idea previously restricted to the realm of science fiction.},
